# Σ-Gravity: Complete Derivation from First Principles
## Goal: Derive g_eff = g_bar[1 + K] from quantum gravitational path summation

## Part I: The Fundamental Postulate

### Postulate 1: Gravitational Field as Quantum Superposition
The gravitational field exists as a superposition of geometric configurations until "measured" by matter interactions.

**Mathematical statement**: The effective metric at point x is:
```
g_μν^eff(x) = ∫ g_μν[h] P[h|x] Dh
```
where h labels distinct geometric configurations and P[h|x] is the probability amplitude for configuration h given the matter distribution.

### Postulate 2: Decoherence from Matter Interactions
Geometries decohere (collapse to classical GR) on timescale τ_collapse ~ (R/c) · f(ρ, v, interactions)

**Key insight**: Compact, dense systems → fast decoherence → classical GR
Extended, sparse systems → slow decoherence → superposition persists → enhancement

---

## Part II: From Path Integral to Enhancement Factor

### Step 1: Weak-field expansion around flat spacetime

Start with metric perturbation:
```
g_μν = η_μν + h_μν,  |h_μν| << 1
```

The gravitational potential φ relates to h_00:
```
h_00 = -2φ/c²
```

### Step 2: Classical (Newtonian) contribution

In the classical limit (single path dominates):
```
φ_N(x) = -G ∫ ρ(x')/|x-x'| d³x'
g_bar = -∇φ_N
```

### Step 3: Quantum correction from path superposition

The TOTAL field includes contributions from ALL near-classical paths:
```
φ_total(x) = φ_N(x) + δφ_quantum(x)
```

where δφ_quantum comes from summing non-stationary paths weighted by:
- Phase factor: exp(iS[path]/ℏ)
- Decoherence factor: exp(-τ_path/τ_collapse)

### Step 4: Stationary phase reduction

For paths close to the classical geodesic, expand:
```
S[path] = S[classical] + ½ δS[deviation]
```

The sum over paths becomes (after Gaussian integration):
```
∑_paths → (1 + coherence_enhancement)
```

### Step 5: The multiplicative structure

CRITICAL: The enhancement is *multiplicative* not additive because:
- Each source element contributes to the field
- Each contribution can take multiple paths
- The superposition principle applies at the AMPLITUDE level
- Squaring gives intensity: |A_classical + A_quantum|² ≈ |A_classical|² (1 + 2Re(A_quantum/A_classical))

Therefore:
```
g_eff = g_bar · (1 + K)
```
where K ≡ 2Re(A_quantum/A_classical) is dimensionless.

## Part III: Geometric Structure of K

### The kernel must satisfy:

1. **Curl-free**: K preserves conservative field
   ∇ × (g_bar[1+K]) = 0  ⟹  ∇ × (g_bar K) = 0

2. **Small-scale collapse**: K → 0 as R → 0 (Newtonian limit)

3. **Large-scale coherence**: K > 0 when R >> ℓ_0

4. **Geometry-dependent**: K depends on mass distribution geometry

### The radial form:

For spherically symmetric or disk-like distributions:
```
K(R) = A · C(R/ℓ_0) · [geometry gates]
```

where:
- A = amplitude from quantum-classical ratio
- C(R/ℓ_0) = coherence window function
- Gates suppress coherence in compact/disturbed regions

---

## Part IV: The Coherence Function C(R/ℓ_0)

### Physical requirements:
- C(0) = 0 (no coherence at origin)
- C(∞) = 1 (full coherence at large scales)
- Transition scale ~ ℓ_0
- Smooth, monotonic

### Functional form from collapse model:

The probability that a region of size R has NOT collapsed is:
```
P_coherent(R) = exp(-R/ℓ_collapse)
```

But quantum mechanics preserves superposition for time τ:
```
P_coherent(t) = exp(-t/τ_collapse)
```

Converting to spatial scale: ℓ_0 = c·τ_collapse

For a gradual transition with characteristic width, use:
```
C(R) = 1 - [1 + (R/ℓ_0)^p]^(-n)
```

This form:
- Has the right limits
- p controls sharpness of onset
- n controls saturation rate
- Reduces to simpler forms for special values

## Part V: Connecting to Observable Phenomenology

### Solar System (R ~ AU):
R/ℓ_0 ~ 10^-9  ⟹  C ≈ 10^-18  ⟹  K ≈ 10^-18 A

Even if A ~ 1, K < 10^-14, satisfying Cassini bounds.

### Galaxies (R ~ 10 kpc):
R/ℓ_0 ~ 2  ⟹  C ≈ 0.5-0.9  ⟹  K ~ 0.5 A

If A ~ 0.6, then 1+K ≈ 1.3, giving ~30% enhancement.

### Clusters (R ~ 100 kpc):
R/ℓ_0 ~ 20  ⟹  C ≈ 1  ⟹  K ≈ A_c

If A_c ~ 4.6, then 1+K ≈ 5.6, giving ~5× enhancement.

This matches observational requirements!

## Part VI: Critical Issues to Resolve

### Issue 1: Why doesn't environmental decoherence destroy coherence?

**Answer**: Gravitational decoherence is fundamentally different from particle decoherence.

For particles: decoherence time ~ ℏ/(interaction energy)
For geometry: decoherence time ~ (size/c)·(something)

The "something" must be related to:
- Collapse frequency of matter into classical states
- Gravitational wave emission timescales
- Self-interaction of the gravitational field

**Proposed mechanism**: τ_collapse ~ (R/c) · (ρ_critical/ρ_local)

Where ρ_critical is the density at which self-measurement occurs.

In Solar System: high ρ, frequent interactions → fast collapse
In galaxy halos: low ρ, rare interactions → slow collapse

### Issue 2: Why is the amplitude A different for galaxies vs clusters?

**Two possibilities**:

A) Universal A, but geometry factors differ:
   - Disks have 2D coherence
   - Clusters have 3D coherence
   - Factor of ~8 difference explained by dimensionality?

B) Mass-dependent A:
   - A ~ (M/M_⋆)^α where α ~ 0 (but allowed to vary)
   - Current data: α = 0.09 ± 0.10 (consistent with universal)

### Issue 3: Why is this curl-free?

**Answer**: The kernel must be constructible from a potential:
```
K(R) = ∇²Φ_quantum / ∇²Φ_classical
```

Or equivalently, the enhanced field has a potential:
```
Φ_eff = Φ_N(1 + K_potential)
g_eff = -∇Φ_eff = -∇Φ_N - Φ_N∇K_potential
```

For K to be curl-free requires specific integral structure.

## Part VII: What Still Needs Rigorous Proof

1. **Derive τ_collapse from first principles**
   - Need microscopic model of gravitational collapse
   - Connect to ORR (Objective Reduction of Reality) theories?
   - Or emergent from gravitational thermodynamics?

2. **Prove curl-free property from path integral**
   - Show that stationary phase reduction preserves conservative structure
   - Demonstrate that azimuthal/angular integrals cancel curl terms

3. **Calculate A from quantum gravity parameters**
   - Express A in terms of fundamental constants (G, c, ℏ, ℓ_Planck)
   - Or show it's a free parameter like fine structure constant?

4. **Explain galaxy-cluster amplitude difference**
   - Dimensionality argument
   - Or genuine mass scaling with α ≠ 0

5. **Numerical validation of elliptic kernel**
   - Verify that ring geometry + coherence gives observed K(R)
   - Check curl explicitly
