# Metric Resonance Tests\n\nMetric fluctuation resonance between Î»_gw and baryonic matter scales.\n\n## Data usage\n- Real observational data: **not used yet** (hook up SPARC/cluster inputs later).\n- Synthetic/toy inputs: **not created yet**; document clearly when introduced.\n\n## Next steps\n1. Port the shared Burr-XII window and multiplier closure from coherence_models.py.\n2. Fit parameters vs. existing Î£-Gravity kernel snapshots.\n3. Summarize any runs (include whether data were empirical or toy).\n
