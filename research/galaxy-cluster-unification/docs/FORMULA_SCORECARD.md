# Complete tested-formula scorecard

This inventory contains **128 scientifically distinct formula/test rows**. It consolidates repeated controls but retains force-law, screen, exponent, path, tensor, metric, and reconstruction variations when they change the tested hypothesis.

## How to read the percentages

The percentages are normalized proximity scores created for this audit; the original scientific scores remain beside them. They are **not** probabilities that a theory is true, confidence levels, or interchangeable likelihoods.

- Galaxy velocity: `100 x max(0, 1 - RMSE / RMS(observed speed))`.
- Observed or derived log acceleration: `100 x 10^(-RMSE_dex)`. A 0.301-dex error is therefore 50% proximity (a typical factor-of-two miss).
- Raw lensing: `100 x max(0, 1 - image-position RMS / RMS(observed image radius))`.
- Raw image positions and GR/NFW-derived acceleration products are kept separate. NFW's 100% derived score is circular by construction, not a prediction.
- A blank means that observable was not tested. Incomplete image roots are not assigned a percentage.

## Highest descriptive proximity scores

Galaxy tests are not all the same split, and raw-lens rows can use different clusters; these lists are navigation aids, not a leaderboard.

## Bottom-line interpretation

1. Fixed RAR and simple MOND remain the strongest universal galaxy controls, at about 93.8% velocity proximity on the untouched SPARC outer points, but their two-cluster raw-lens proximity is only about 5–6%.
2. The RAR + squared coherence-gated RG bridge is the only tested project formula that is simultaneously close to RAR on observational SPARC data and very close on its one-cluster raw-lens test. That raw result has not yet transferred to multiple clusters, so it is promising evidence, not a universal solution.
3. On the four-cluster transfer, the best locked modified-gravity scalar law is roughly 29% raw-lens proximity, while the compact-halo comparator is roughly 65%. Adding member-light vectors does not close the gap.
4. The new full member-tidal tensor test selects zero coupling and gives essentially the same two-cluster error as the scalar-slip parent. Strong negative couplings improve a local fitting cost but lose exact image roots, so changing the number does not rescue it.
5. The Solar-screened isothermal tail now has a direct morphology-stratified galaxy test. Its locked cluster value scores 18.60 km/s overall and is especially poor for disk-dominated, dwarf, late-type, flat/rising systems; it is therefore not the missing universal bridge.
6. Conservative radial diffusion confirms that the transported physical quantity matters: added acceleration is lensing-favored, while short-scale circular-speed-squared transport is nearly galaxy-neutral. No diffusion carrier improves the complete-root cross-domain control, and diffusion after the best memory response loses lens roots.
7. No tested formula yet matches both trusted galaxy controls and multi-cluster dark-matter lens reconstructions with one universal setting. The most defensible next test is the existing RAR + coherence/RG candidate on several clusters using complete baryonic maps (gas, BCG, ICL, and member galaxies), with its constants frozen before image scoring.
