# Path Interference

Focus: treat Î£-Gravity as quantum-path interference where the coherence
length L_coh shrinks with the systemâ€™s velocity dispersion.

- Kernel: Burr-XII with R / L_coh; use `path_interference_multiplier`.
- Data flag: **no real observations loaded yet**; start with analytic toy
  curves until a proper SPARC ingestion script lives here.
- To run tests: drop notebooks/scripts plus a short run summary describing
  whether the inputs were observational or synthetic and what residuals you
  saw versus the baseline Î£ kernel.
