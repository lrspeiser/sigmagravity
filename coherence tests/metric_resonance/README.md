# Metric Resonance

Focus: log-normal resonance between Î»_gw and a characteristic matter scale
combined with a Burr-XII radial window.

- Kernel: `metric_resonance_multiplier` (resonant C_res Ã— C_R).
- Data flag: **currently toy-only**; document clearly when real orbital or
  gravitational-wave spectra enter.
- Testing notes: capture resonance width fits, Ïƒ_v dependence, and summarize
  whether the mechanism reproduces the Î£-Gravity enhancement without
  overfitting.
