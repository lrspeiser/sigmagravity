# Vacuum Condensation

Focus: stochastic vacuum condensation that activates below a critical
velocity dispersion, acting like an order parameter.

- Kernel: `vacuum_condensation_multiplier` (phase-transition-style f_cond).
- Data flag: **purely analytic at the moment**; mark clearly when importing
  real kinematic catalogs.
- Testing notes: tabulate sigma_c/alpha/beta fits and short residual
  summaries for every experiment.
