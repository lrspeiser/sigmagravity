# Coherence Tests Sandbox

This directory prototypes coherence/decoherence mechanisms for Î£-Gravity without touching the canonical data or manuscript assets. Use it for exploratory code and documentation only.

## Data status
- No real observational data are copied here. When a notebook or script references the main datasets (SPARC, clusters, etc.), document it explicitly in that file.
- Any synthetic or toy inputs must be labeled in-code and in accompanying notes so future readers know they are not empirical results.

## Current subprojects
- `path_interference/` â€“ quantum path interference closure tests.
- `metric_resonance/` â€“ metric fluctuation resonance sketches.
- `entanglement/` â€“ entanglement-mediated gravity scenarios.
- `vacuum_condensation/` â€“ stochastic vacuum condensation order parameters.
- `graviton_pairing/` â€“ non-local graviton pairing studies.

Each folder can grow its own notebooks, scripts, and result summaries as we iterate from observation â†’ microphysical root cause.
