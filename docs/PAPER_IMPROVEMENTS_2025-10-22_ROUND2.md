# Paper Improvements - Round 2: Technical Refinements (2025-10-22)

## Summary

Implemented high-impact technical fixes from detailed follow-up review. These changes address dimensional consistency, scope NFW claims appropriately, explain cross-domain coherence scales, and add critical clarifications about the g† factor and curl-free field.

## High-Impact Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Softened Appendix F Title and Phrasing** ✅

**Problem:** Appendix F heading still said "rigorous derivation" despite earlier clarifications.

**Fix:**
- Changed title: "Σ‑Gravity rigorous derivation" → "Stationary‑phase reduction and phenomenological coherence window"
- Added first sentence: "This appendix collects technical details that motivate the operator structure... it is not a first‑principles derivation of C(R)."

**Impact:** Consistent messaging throughout paper about what's derived vs phenomenological.

---

### 2. **Fixed Dimensional Analysis of ℓ₀** ✅

**Problem:** Need to explicitly tie coherence length to dynamical time t_dyn.

**Fix (Appendix F.1):**
- Made explicit connection: $t_{\rm dyn}\sim 1/\sqrt{G\rho}$
- Rewrote formula: $\ell_0 \equiv c\,\tau_{\rm collapse} \approx \frac{c}{\alpha\sqrt{G\rho}}$
- Added dimensional example: For $\rho\sim 10^{-21}$ kg m$^{-3}$, this gives $\ell_0\sim \mathcal{O}(10)$ kpc$/\sqrt{\alpha}$
- Consistent with fitted disk value (~5 kpc) for $\alpha\sim$ few

**Impact:** Dimensionally rigorous, explicit connection to standard dynamical timescales.

---

### 3. **Added Observable-Effective Coherence Scale Explanation** ✅

**Problem:** ℓ₀ ~ 5 kpc (galaxies) vs ~ 200 kpc (clusters) looks like two different parameters without explanation.

**Fix (§2.8 and §6):**

Added new subsection in §2.8:
> **Observable‑effective coherence scales.** Throughout we distinguish an observable‑effective coherence scale: $\ell_{0}^{\rm dyn}\sim 5$ kpc for rotation‑supported disks and $\ell_{0}^{\rm proj}\sim 200$ kpc for projected lensing. The γ test pertains to within‑domain mass‑scaling; current posteriors ($\gamma=0.09\pm 0.10$) favor no mass‑scaling in clusters, while $\ell_{0}^{\rm dyn}$ and $\ell_{0}^{\rm proj}$ differ because the observables integrate different path ensembles: disks sample 3‑D mass projected onto a 2‑D rotation‑supported midplane (relevant phase‑coherence scale ~ few kpc), whereas lensing involves line‑of‑sight projection over 3‑D volumes that effectively coarse‑grains phases (projected coherence scale ~ 10² kpc).

Also added to §6 Mass-scaling paragraph with same explanation.

**Impact:** Preempts "two different ℓ₀'s = not universal" objection. Clear physical explanation.

---

### 4. **Scoped NFW Claim in §5.4** ✅

**Problem:** §5.4 interpretation said "NFW decisively ruled out" which contradicts the scoped language in §1.

**Fix (§5.4 Interpretation):**
- Changed bullet point from "NFW decisively ruled out" to:
> **Tested NFW realization ruled out for the MW** (V₂₀₀=180 km s⁻¹): Catastrophic +1.409 dex mean residual (25× worse than Σ; Figure MW-1, MW-4) demonstrates that this fixed halo configuration cannot match Milky Way star-level accelerations. This statement applies to that realization, not to per-galaxy tuned ΛCDM fits used in SPARC population comparisons.

**Impact:** Consistent scoping throughout paper. Strong claim for tested realization without overreach.

---

### 5. **Added PPC Calibration Note** ✅

**Problem:** 88.9% coverage inside nominal 68% is over-covering, suggesting conservative uncertainties.

**Fix (§5.3):**
Added calibration bullet:
> • **Calibration note:** PPC bands slightly over‑cover (∼89% inside nominal 68%), indicating conservative uncertainty estimates from geometry priors (q_p, q_LOS) and κ_ext ~ N(0, 0.05²); we will tighten priors as the sample grows.

**Impact:** Honest about calibration. Shows awareness of slight over-coverage and plans to address.

---

### 6. **Explained g† Factor (Dynamics vs Lensing)** ✅

**Problem:** Galaxy kernel has $(g^†/g_{\rm bar})^p$ but cluster kernel doesn't; need rationale.

**Fix (§2.7):**
- Enhanced definition: "Here $g^†$ is a fixed acceleration scale (value and provenance listed in Methods §4.2); the ratio $(g^†/g_{\rm bar})^p$ encodes the path‑spectrum slope relevant for dynamics, not lensing."
- Added note:
> **Note:** The $(g^†/g_{\rm bar})^p$ factor appears only for dynamical observables where accelerations are measured; lensing depends on surface density, so the projected kernel (§2.8) uses $C(R)$ without an explicit $g_{\rm bar}$ ratio.

**Impact:** Preempts "two different kernels" objection. Clear physical distinction between observables.

---

### 7. **Specified Axisymmetric Gates for Curl-Free Field** ✅

**Problem:** Gates (bulge/shear/bar) could break curl-free property if not properly handled.

**Fix (§2.9):**
Enhanced curl-free bullet:
> • Curl‑free field: conservative potential; loop curl tests pass. **Axisymmetric gates:** All geometry gates (bulge/shear/bar) are evaluated as axisymmetrized functions of R via measured morphology, ensuring $K=K(R)$ and a curl‑free effective field.

**Impact:** Explicit guarantee that gates preserve curl-free property through axisymmetry.

---

### 8. **Added Zero-Shot Policy Note** ✅

**Enhancement:** Added prominent note after comparison table in §1:

> **Zero‑shot policy:** For all disks—including the Milky Way—we use a single, frozen galaxy kernel calibrated on SPARC. Only baryons and measured morphology vary by galaxy; no per‑galaxy parameters are tuned.

**Impact:** Reinforces universality message at first encounter with results.

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

Nice-to-have additions mentioned by reviewer (not critical):
1. MW typicality plot (placing MW on SPARC leave-one-out distribution)

3. Compact notation table (already partially in §1)
4. κ_ext prior justification (standard practice, brief note)
5. PIT/coverage calibration plot

These can be added in revision or supplement without changing main results.
