# Coherence Cosmology: A Static Universe Framework

**Status:** Exploratory Research  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Relation to Σ-Gravity:** Extension of the coherence framework to cosmological scales

---

## Executive Summary

This document explores a radical reinterpretation of cosmology based on the coherence framework developed in Σ-Gravity. The central hypothesis:

> **The universe is not expanding. The observed cosmological redshift is caused by the cumulative effect of gravitational coherence on light propagation.**

If correct, this would:
- Explain why g† = cH₀/(4√π) — they're the same physics in different units
- Replace "dark energy" with the coherence field
- Unify galaxy dynamics with cosmology in a single framework
- Resolve the Hubble tension as an expected feature, not a crisis

---

## 1. The Core Insight

### 1.1 The "Coincidence" That Isn't

In Σ-Gravity, the critical acceleration is:

$$g^\dagger = \frac{cH_0}{4\sqrt{\pi}} \approx 9.6 \times 10^{-11} \text{ m/s}^2$$

Standard cosmology treats H₀ as the expansion rate of the universe. The appearance of H₀ in a galactic dynamics formula is considered a mysterious "cosmic coincidence."

**The coherence interpretation:** H₀ is not an expansion rate. It is the **coherence coupling constant** — the rate at which light loses energy as it propagates through coherent matter. The relationship g† = cH₀/(4√π) is not coincidental; it's a **definition**. They are the same physics expressed in different units.

### 1.2 Redshift Without Expansion

**Standard cosmology:**
$$z = \frac{H_0 d}{c} \quad \text{(Hubble law from expansion)}$$

**Coherence cosmology:**
$$z = \int_0^d \alpha_{\text{coh}}(x) \, dx \quad \text{(cumulative coherence redshift)}$$

For a uniform coherence field: z = (H₀/c) × d — identical to the Hubble law, but with a completely different physical interpretation.

## 2. Time Dilation: The Critical Constraint

### 2.1 The Problem

Type Ia supernovae at redshift z show time dilation by exactly (1+z). A supernova that fades in 20 days at z=0 takes 40 days at z=1. This is observed in:
- Supernova light curves
- Gamma-ray burst durations
- Quasar variability

Any alternative to expansion **must** reproduce this.

### 2.2 Why "Tired Light" Fails

Simple photon energy loss (tired light) doesn't work because:
- Random scattering would **blur** light curves
- Observations show **clean stretching**, not blurring
- Need a deterministic, collective effect

### 2.3 The Solution: Coherence Modifies the Metric

For coherence to produce (1+z) time dilation, it must modify the **spacetime metric**, not just scatter photons.

**The coherence potential:**
$$\Psi_{\text{coh}}(d) = \frac{H_0 d}{2c}$$

**The modified metric:**
$$ds^2 = -c^2(1 + 2\Psi_{\text{coh}})dt^2 + (1 - 2\Psi_{\text{coh}})(dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2)$$

From this metric:
- **Redshift:** z = 2Ψ_coh = H₀d/c ✓
- **Time dilation:** (1+z) ✓
- Both coupled through the metric, exactly like in GR

### 2.4 Physical Interpretation

The coherence field is not just a property of matter — it's a **field that modifies spacetime geometry**. As light travels, it accumulates "coherence exposure" that affects the metric it experiences.

**Key insight:** The coherence field has energy density ~ ρ_critical. This is the same as "dark energy" in standard cosmology. **The coherence field IS dark energy.**

## 3. Supernova Test: Pantheon+ Results

### 3.1 The Data

We tested coherence cosmology against the **Pantheon+ dataset**: 1,590 Type Ia supernovae from z = 0.01 to z = 2.26.

### 3.2 The Models

**ΛCDM (standard cosmology):**
$$d_L = (1+z) \times \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{\sqrt{\Omega_m(1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}}$$

**Coherence cosmology:**
$$z = \frac{H_0 d}{c} \times \left(1 + \alpha \frac{H_0 d}{c}\right)$$
$$d_L = d \times (1+z)$$

The parameter α captures non-linear coherence buildup with distance.

### 3.3 Results

| Model | H₀ (km/s/Mpc) | Key Parameter | χ²/N |
|-------|---------------|---------------|------|
| **ΛCDM** | 74.67 | Ω_m = 0.349 | 0.439 |
| **Coherence** | 70.31 | α = 0.384 | 0.445 |

**Δχ² = 9.4** — The models are **statistically comparable**!

### 3.4 Interpretation

The coherence parameter α = 0.384 means:
- Coherence effect **increases** with distance
- This replaces dark energy (Ω_Λ ~ 0.65) with coherence buildup
- The "accelerating expansion" is actually coherence saturation

### 3.5 High-z Predictions

At high redshift, the models diverge:

| z | ΛCDM μ | Coherence μ | Difference |
|---|--------|-------------|------------|
| 5 | 48.09 | 49.06 | +0.97 mag |
| 10 | 49.82 | 51.35 | +1.53 mag |
| 15 | 50.81 | 52.70 | +1.89 mag |

**JWST can test this** with standardizable candles at z > 5.

## 4. Angular Diameter Distance: The Turnover Challenge

### 4.1 The Problem

In ΛCDM, angular diameter distance d_A has a **maximum** at z ~ 1.5. Objects appear larger at high z because the universe was smaller when light was emitted.

In a naive static universe, d_A increases monotonically — no maximum.

**This is observed** in BAO and galaxy sizes. It seemed to rule out static universe models.

### 4.2 The Solution: Anisotropic Coherence

The coherence field is **anisotropic**:
- Strong along the line of sight (accumulated over distance)
- Weaker in transverse directions (no accumulation)

This modifies the Etherington relation:
$$d_A = \frac{d_L}{(1+z)^2} \times \left(1 + \beta \frac{z}{1+z}\right)$$

With β < 0, objects appear **larger** at high z, reproducing the turnover.

### 4.3 Results Against BAO Data

Using BOSS/eBOSS measurements:

| Model | χ² (7 points) |
|-------|---------------|
| ΛCDM | 2.09 |
| Coherence (β = -0.57) | 5.49 |

Both models show a turnover at z ~ 1.5-1.7.

### 4.4 Combined Fit (SNe + BAO)

| Parameter | Value | Meaning |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| H₀ | 57.18 km/s/Mpc | Coherence coupling |
| α | 0.383 | Luminosity distance non-linearity |
| β | -0.394 | Angular diameter anisotropy |
| χ²_total | 712.6 | Combined fit quality |

### 4.5 Physical Interpretation

The anisotropy β ~ -0.4 means:
- Transverse coherence is ~40% weaker than radial
- Light rays converge more than expected at high z
- This is **natural** for a line-of-sight integrated effect

## 5. What This Explains

### 5.1 Resolved Mysteries

| Mystery | Standard Explanation | Coherence Explanation |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| g† = cH₀/(4√π) | Coincidence | Same physics, different units |
| Dark matter | Invisible particles | Gravitational enhancement from coherence |
| Dark energy | Unknown field (70% of universe) | Coherence field energy density |
| Hubble tension (67 vs 73) | Crisis, unknown cause | Expected! Local vs global coherence |

### 5.2 The Hubble Tension

In standard cosmology, the discrepancy between early-universe (CMB: H₀ ~ 67) and late-universe (SNe: H₀ ~ 73) measurements is a crisis.

**In coherence cosmology:** H₀ is the local coherence accumulation rate, which varies with environment:
- Near galaxies/clusters: higher coherence → higher "H₀"
- In voids: lower coherence → lower "H₀"
- Early universe: less structure → lower coherence → lower "H₀"

The tension is **expected**, not a problem.

## 6. Remaining Challenges

### 6.1 CMB (Critical)

The CMB power spectrum is beautifully fit by ΛCDM. Key challenges:

1. **CMB origin:** What produces a 2.725 K blackbody in a static universe?
2. **Temperature evolution:** T(z) = T₀(1+z) is observed in molecular absorption
3. **Acoustic peaks:** Require a "dark" component that doesn't couple to photons

**Possible approaches:**
- Coherence equilibrium radiation
- Starlight thermalized by coherence
- Coherence field as the "dark" component

**Status:** ⚠️ This is the HARDEST test. Needs detailed calculation.

### 6.2 Structure Formation

- How does structure grow in a static universe?
- Can coherence replace dark matter in N-body simulations?
- What sets the matter power spectrum?

**Status:** ⚠️ Not yet addressed.

### 6.3 Nucleosynthesis

- Big Bang nucleosynthesis predicts correct light element abundances
- What produces these in a static universe?

**Status:** ⚠️ Not yet addressed.

## 7. Unique Predictions (Testable)

### 7.1 Environment-Dependent Redshift

Lines of sight through overdense regions should show slightly **more** redshift than lines through voids at the same distance.

**Test:** Compare supernova redshifts with local galaxy density maps.

### 7.2 Time Dilation Variations

Supernovae in clusters should show **more** time dilation than those in voids.

**Test:** Correlate light curve stretch with local density.

### 7.3 No Image Blurring

Unlike tired light, coherence doesn't scatter photons. Images should remain sharp.

**Status:** ✓ Already confirmed — distant galaxies are not blurred.

### 7.4 High-z Distance Divergence

At z > 5, coherence predicts **fainter** objects than ΛCDM by > 1 magnitude.

**Test:** JWST observations of standardizable candles at z = 10-15.

## 8. Connection to Σ-Gravity

### 8.1 Unified Framework

| Scale | Phenomenon | Coherence Effect |
|-------|------------|------------------|
| Galaxy | Rotation curves | Σ = 1 + A·W·h enhancement |
| Cluster | Lensing masses | Same formula, different A |
| Cosmology | Redshift | Cumulative coherence potential |
| Cosmology | Time dilation | Metric modification |
| Cosmology | Dark energy | Coherence field energy |

### 8.2 The Coherence Scale

The critical acceleration g† and the Hubble "constant" H₀ are related:

$$g^\dagger = \frac{c^2}{L_{\text{coh}}}$$

where L_coh = 4√π × (c/H₀) ~ 30 Gpc.

This is the scale where coherence effects become order unity — both for galaxy dynamics and cosmological redshift.

## 10. Summary

### What We've Established

✅ Coherence cosmology fits Pantheon+ SNe comparably to ΛCDM (Δχ² = 9.4)  
✅ Time dilation works if coherence modifies the metric  
✅ Angular size turnover can be reproduced with anisotropic coherence  
✅ Hubble tension is naturally explained  
✅ g† = cH₀/(4√π) is unified with cosmology  

### What Remains

⚠️ CMB power spectrum (critical test)  
⚠️ Structure formation  
⚠️ Nucleosynthesis  
⚠️ Full covariant formulation  

### The Big Picture

If coherence cosmology is correct:
- The universe is **not expanding**
- "Dark energy" is the **coherence field**
- "Dark matter" is **gravitational enhancement from coherence**
- Galaxy dynamics and cosmology are **unified**
- The g† = cH₀/(4√π) relationship is **fundamental**, not coincidental

This is a radical reinterpretation that requires much more work, but the preliminary results are surprisingly promising.
