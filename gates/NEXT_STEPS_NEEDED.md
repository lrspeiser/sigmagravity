# Next Steps - Need Your Input

**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Status:** Research paused - waiting for baseline script

---

## ✅ What's Complete

### 1. Main Paper PDF ✅
- **docs/sigmagravity_paper.pdf** - Ready for publication
- All formatting fixed
- **UNTOUCHED - as requested**

### 2. Gate Validation Infrastructure ✅
- Complete package in `gates/`
- All tools working
- Tested on real SPARC data

## ⏸️ What's Paused

### Need: Baseline Script That Produces 0.087 dex

**Problem:** Your README.md references:
- `many_path_model/run_full_tuning_pipeline.py`
- `many_path_model/validation_suite.py`

**Reality:** These directories/files don't exist in current repository

---

## 🎯 What We Need From You

### Please provide ONE of:

**Option 1: The script** (Best!)
```
"The script that produces 0.087 dex is: [script name]"
```

**Option 2: The command** (Also good!)
```
"Run this command: python [script.py] [args]"
```

**Option 3: The methodology** (We'll reconstruct)
```
"Here's how 0.087 dex was computed: [description]"
```

---

## 🚀 Once We Have Baseline

**What we'll do:**

1. **Run baseline script**
   - Verify it gives ~0.087 dex
   - Document exact methodology

2. **Create modified version**
   - Copy to `gates/baseline_with_new_gates.py`
   - Change ONLY gates (everything else identical)

3. **Compare results**
   ```
   Baseline:    0.087 dex (verified)
   New gates:   ??? dex (to measure)
   ```

4. **Report findings**
   - In `gates/` only
   - Not in main paper (research phase)

---

## 📊 Current Status

**What we know works:**
- ✅ Gate formulas mathematically sound
- ✅ Tested on 143 SPARC galaxies (generic implementation)
- ✅ Found 27.9% improvement (but wrong baseline!)

**What we need:**
- ⏳ Your actual baseline script
- ⏳ Verification it gives 0.087 dex
- ⏳ True comparison

---

## 💬 Summary

**Main paper:** ✅ Ready (PDF generated, untouched)

**Gates research:** ✅ Infrastructure complete, ⏳ waiting for baseline

**Next:** Please tell us which script/command produces 0.087 dex, and we'll:
1. Verify baseline
2. Test new gates
3. Give you true comparison
4. All in `gates/` (main paper untouched)

**Awaiting your input on baseline script!** 🎯
