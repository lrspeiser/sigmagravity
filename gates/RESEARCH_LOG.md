# Gate Research Log - Session 2025-10-22

**Status:** Research phase - Main paper untouched ✅

---

## 📋 Session Objectives

1. ✅ Fix PDF generation → **COMPLETE**
2. ✅ Build gate validation infrastructure → **COMPLETE**
3. ⏳ Find baseline script (0.087 dex) → **IN PROGRESS**
4. ⏳ Compare new vs. current gates → **WAITING FOR BASELINE**

---

## ✅ Completed Work

### PDF Generation (Main Objective)
- Fixed all formatting issues
- Clean PDF ready: `docs/sigmagravity_paper.pdf`
- **Main paper ready for submission!**

### Gate Infrastructure (`gates/` directory)
- Complete gate function library
- Theoretical validation (Burr-XII on Pareto front)
- Real SPARC tests (143 galaxies)
- Comprehensive documentation

---

## 🔍 Current Task: Find Baseline Script

### What We're Looking For

Script that produces: **0.087 dex SPARC hold-out scatter**

### Search Results So Far

**From README.md citations:**
- `many_path_model/run_full_tuning_pipeline.py` → **NOT FOUND** (directory doesn't exist)
- `many_path_model/validation_suite.py` → **NOT FOUND**
- `many_path_model/path_spectrum_kernel.py` → **NOT FOUND**

**Available scripts:**
- `scripts/generate_rar_plot.py` → Generates figure, uses PathSpectrumKernel
- `vendor/maxdepth_gaia/run_pipeline.py` → Has SPARC mode
- `scripts/analyze_mw_rar_starlevel.py` → MW analysis only

**Hypothesis:** Code might be:
1. In a different branch
2. Renamed/moved to vendor/
3. Not committed to repository
4. Referenced path is outdated

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Option A: Reconstruct from Documentation

If the exact scripts aren't available, reconstruct from paper description:
1. Load SPARC with proper filters
2. Use hyperparams from config/hyperparams_track2.json
3. Compute RAR with 80/20 split
4. Verify we get ~0.087 dex

### Option B: Ask User

Most efficient: Ask user which script produces 0.087 dex

---

## 📊 Test Results Status

### What's Validated ✅
- Gates emerge from constraints
- PPN safety (K ~ 10⁻²⁰)
- Explicit gates work on SPARC

### What's NOT Validated ⚠️
- Comparison to actual 0.087 dex baseline
- Claims of improvement
- Integration benefits

---

## 📝 Research Findings (Preliminary)

### Test on Generic Implementation (143 SPARC galaxies)

| Method | Scatter |
|--------|---------|
| Generic current | 0.1749 dex |
| Generic new | 0.1261 dex |
| Improvement | 27.9% |

**Caveat:** Not comparable to published 0.087 dex (different implementation)

**Interpretation:**
- Within generic framework: new gates better
- Relative to actual pipeline: unknown

---

## 🎯 Status Summary

**Main Paper:**
- ✅ PDF ready
- ✅ Formatting fixed
- ✅ Untouched (as requested)

**Gates Research:**
- ✅ Infrastructure complete
- ⏳ Baseline search in progress
- ⏳ True comparison pending

**Next:** Continue baseline search or await user input on which script to use.

## 📁 Key Files

**Research outputs (all in `gates/`):**
- BASELINE_SEARCH_RESULTS.md - Search status
- CRITICAL_BASELINE_ISSUE.md - Problem explained
- RESEARCH_LOG.md - This file

**DO NOT EDIT:**
- README.md (main paper)
- docs/sigmagravity_paper.pdf

**Workflow:** Keep all research in `gates/`, main paper stays clean.

---

**Status:** Awaiting baseline script identification before proceeding with gate comparison.
