Honest parameter status revisions: fix arithmetic errors and overclaims

CRITICAL FIX:
- f_geom = 2.5 from NFW formula was WRONG: 2ln(1+c)/c = 0.80 for c=4, not 2.5
- Removed all claims that f_geom is "derived" - it's now marked empirical

README changes:
- Abstract: Acknowledge varying rigor levels (1 rigorous, 2 numeric, 2 motivated, 1 empirical)
- §1.1: Changed "Parameters motivated 5/6" to honest breakdown
- §2.2: Renamed to "Parameter Constraints", added Status column to table
- §2.2: Revised p and g† descriptions to acknowledge non-uniqueness
- §2.2: Fixed f_geom description (removed wrong 2.5=NFW claim)
- §2.4: New "Derivation Status: What Is and Isn't Proven" section
- §6.2: Fixed amplitude scaling section (removed "fully derived" claim)
- §8: Added theoretical status paragraph to conclusion

SI changes:
- §6 V: Removed "DERIVED" label, corrected NFW projection math
- §7.4: Changed to "Motivated (not derived)", noted decomposition non-uniqueness
- §7.5: Changed to "Empirical (partially motivated)", showed correct NFW math
- §7.10: Updated comparison table with honest status breakdown

This addresses the core issue: the NFW formula 2ln(1+c)/c gives 0.80 for c=4,
NOT 2.5 as previously claimed. The factor ~2.5 remains unexplained.
